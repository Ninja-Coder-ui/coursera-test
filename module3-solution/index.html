                    The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and
                    a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming
                    both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7
                    billion as of 2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird. There are numerous cultural references to chickens – in myth, folklore and religion, and in language and literature.

                    <br /><br /> A chicken ( Gallus gallus domesticus) is a kind of domesticated bird. It is raised in many places for its meat and eggs. They are usually kept by humans as livestock. Most breeds of chickens can fly for a short distance.
                    Some sleep in trees (if there are trees around). <br /><br />Chicken has well-documented health benefits, but different parts and preparation methods factor into how healthy your chicken-based meal turns out. Darker cuts like the thigh
                    and drumstick contain higher caloric content than lighter cuts like the breast. Keeping the skin or frying chicken will also add saturated fat. If you’re switching out red meat for chicken, you’ll want to stick with chicken breast,
                    as it’s the healthiest cut of the bird.
                    <br /><br />The lean protein in chicken is an excellent source of amino acids. Our bodies use amino acids to build muscle tissue, something that is particularly important as we age. Studies have also shown that higher protein intake
                    helps to maintain bone mineral density. Eating chicken can help to build stronger muscles and promote healthier bones, decreasing the risk of injuries and diseases such as osteoporosis.Sushi was known originally as a way of preserving
                    food. Fish was fermented with salt and placed in rice, which allowed people to keep the fish edible for some time. The rice was then discarded while the fish was eaten if needed. Around the seventh century, the method eventually headed
                    to Japan after spreading throughout China. The Japanese made their special remarks by deciding to eat the rice together with the fish. By the 17th century, Matsumoto Yoshiichi of Edo (Tokyo nowadays) started seasoning the rice with
                    rice wine vinegar and this is when modern day sushi began. By his method, sushi can be eaten immediately instead of months of preparing.
