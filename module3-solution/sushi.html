                    Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients (ねた, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles
                    of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1] The inventor of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type
                    of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period (1603–1867). It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.
                    <br /><br />Sushi is famous to be one of the most impressive creations of Japanese cuisine. Sushi is a Japanese dish with rice traditionally wrapped in a piece of nori seaweed. It has conquered the whole world for its mild and neutral
                    flavors as well as appealing visual beauty. Japan Shore Excursions’ team is here to provide sushi-lovers interesting information about this famous and iconic Japanese food. Moreover, we also offer cruise tours heading to Japan port
                    cities where visitors can experience Japanese culture and try on fresh sushi at some of the most famous sushi restaurants there. <br /><br />Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle (Bos taurus). In prehistoric times, humankind
                    hunted aurochs and later domesticated them. Since that time, numerous breeds of cattle have been bred specifically for the quality or quantity of their meat. Today, beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, after pork
                    and poultry. As of 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China were the largest producers of beef. Beef can be prepared in various ways; cuts are often used for steak, which can be cooked to varying degrees of doneness, while trimmings
                    are often ground or minced, as found in most hamburgers. Beef contains protein, iron, and vitamin B12. Along with other kinds of red meat, high consumption is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and coronary heart
                    disease, especially when processed. Beef has a high environmental impact, being a primary driver of deforestation with the highest greenhouse gas emissions of any agricultural product. <br /><br />Sushi was known originally as a way
                    of preserving food. Fish was fermented with salt and placed in rice, which allowed people to keep the fish edible for some time. The rice was then discarded while the fish was eaten if needed. Around the seventh century, the method
                    eventually headed to Japan after spreading throughout China. The Japanese made their special remarks by deciding to eat the rice together with the fish. By the 17th century, Matsumoto Yoshiichi of Edo (Tokyo nowadays) started seasoning
                    the rice with rice wine vinegar and this is when modern day sushi began. By his method, sushi can be eaten immediately instead of months of preparing.
